# PhotoGallery

This project was developed as my personal project in learning Django framework.
The back-end language is using Python 3 and Django as the web framework. 
The front-end used only Html and CSS.

No Framework was used for the front-end. Jinja2 is a templating language used default in Django.

Any user can upload and view photos without login.
However, only the admin can log in and update or delete the photos in the gallery.
